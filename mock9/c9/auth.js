// ### `Instructions`

// - Read entire question carefully for atleast 15 mins, understand it and and then start coding.
// - Donâ€™t jump directly into code.
// - Use React along with redux to solve this.
// - Commit your code and push it every hour with proper commit message to your repository (we will monitor every commit).
// - You can use any CSS library of your choice (MUI, Chakra UI)

// # Problem Statement

// - Your app should have three pages with following routes
//     - Login - `/login`
//     - Sign up - `/signup`
//     - Home page - `/`
// - Home page should be private route which can only be accessible after user is logged in.

// ### Signup Page ( /signup):

// - This page should take following information from user
//     - Name
//     - Email
//     - Password
// - Once user submits the form, store user data in JSON server (POST Request)
// - Use proper form validations (user should fill all fields in order to submit)
// - Use loader while posting data.
// - Note that multiple users should be able to signup.
// - UI should be decent (bonus marks)

// ### Login Page ( /login):

// - This page should take following information from user
//     - Email
//     - Password
// - User should be able to login with signed up data(fetch data from mock server) else show an error.
// - Use proper form validations and loaders.
// - Once successfully logged in, move user to Home page (/).
// - User should be able to logout as well.
// - When logged out, redirect user to login page.
// - UI should be decent (bonus marks)

// ### Home Page (/):

// - Home page should have a navbar with details of logged in user.
// - Home page should also have text box, where user can post a message on social media (similar to facebook).
// - Along with text box, user should be able to post a GIF by clicking on GIF button and searching for GIFs
// - You can use `Giphy` API - [https://developers.giphy.com/](https://developers.giphy.com/)
// - Output should look similar to -

// ### Submission

// - Please submit deployed link and Github link of code.
// - Push your code into masai-repo, creating personal repos will lead to disqualification.
// - ***Deploy JSON server too.
// - Please double check if deployed version works or not (run deployed version on your laptop and then submit it)
// - Any issues in deployed link, will be considered null and void.
// - Please verify your submissions are correct.
// - Make sure you follow all instructions carefully.
// - Submit before deadline.

// ### Rubrics / Criteria to be judged upon

// - HTML, CSS, React
// - Redux
// - JSON server
// - MUI / Chakra UI
// - Pixel perfect design
// - Code cleanliness
