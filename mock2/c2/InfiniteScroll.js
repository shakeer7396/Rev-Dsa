// **Instructions**

// - `**PART I**`
// - you have to use pure, html, css, vanilla js
// - you cannot use any external css
// - you cannot refer any other resource during evaluation

// You are required to make a list that will scroll infinitely

// - add 25 items on load
// - user overflow css property to manage the scrollbar for the div
// - add event listener to list element
// - use scroll event
// - check a condition to see if you have reached the end of the element
// - look at the following properties in the Element API
// - scrollTop
// - clientHeight
// - scrollHeight
// - getBoundingClientRect
// - getClientRects
// - use in any combination to achieve your task
// - when the condition is met, load 25 more items into the list
// - For the ones who are got it already done in plain JS
// - **`PART II`**
// - **A user should also be able to click on the Masai Student <number>**
//     - It should open up a modal in the following manner
//     - On Click it should show 
//     **User name   -   X (close button)
//     button -Continue**
//     The close button and continue button will close the modal for the user
//     - You should be able to use the following classes,
//     modal, modal-content, modal-header, title, close-btn, modal-body, modal-footer, into different elements
// - You need to use z-index and positions property to achieve this
// - You should be creating `onCloseModal` `onOpenModal` functions
// - You need both parts to be implemented, mandatory
// - Modals are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the `<body>` so that modal content scrolls instead.
//     - Clicking on the modal “backdrop” will automatically close the modal
    

// ### Submission

// - please submit deployed link and github link to code
// - any issues in submission, will be considered null and void
// - please double check if deployed version works or not
// - if you end up using json server locally, and its not working in your deployed version, you will not get any marks
// - please verify your submission is correct

// ### What matters?

// - completion of the problem
// - implementation details
// - custom logic
// - clean code
